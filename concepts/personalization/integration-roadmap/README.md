# Integration Roadmap

## Roadmap {#BloomReachintegrationroadmap-Roadmap}

There are several milestones or deliverables for a BloomReach integration. We recommend that you complete the platform milestones first: pixel and feeds. Your BloomReach TPM reviews all the milestones with you during kickoff.

1. [Kickoff](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+1.+Kickoff)
2. [Pixel deployment](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+2.+Pixel+deployment)
3. [Feed delivery](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+3.+Feed+delivery)
4. [API deployment](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+4.+API+deployment)
5. [Listen and tune](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+5.+Listen+and+tune)
6. [Data deployment](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+6.+Data+deployment)
7. [Day zero](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+7.+Day+zero)

## I'm only integrating Insights features. {#BloomReachintegrationroadmap-I'monlyintegratingInsightsfeatures.}

Your integration path is a little different from an integration of the full BloomReach Personalization or BloomReach Organic products. During the integration kickoff meeting, your BloomReach TPM walks you through which milestones are relevant to your Insights-only integration. Here are the milestones for a typical Insights-only integration:

* [Milestone 1. Kickoff](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+1.+Kickoff)
* [Milestone 2. Pixel deployment](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+2.+Pixel+deployment)
* [Milestone 3. Feed delivery](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+3.+Feed+delivery) \(optional, but recommended\)
* [Milestone 5. Listen and tune](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+5.+Listen+and+tune)
* [Milestone 7. Day zero](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+7.+Day+zero)

You can skip [Milestone 4](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+4.+API+deployment) and [Milestone 6](https://help.bloomreach.com/display/BRINT/Milestone+6.+Data+deployment). There is no API integration for an Insights-only integration.
