# Ideas on how to get started:

Think about:

* What've you been working on?
* What gets you excited?
* What have you learned?

## Past, Present & Prediction

Nearly every article can be broken down into three major plot points — what happened before, what happened after \(i.e., where you’re at now\), and what’s going to happen in the future. Let’s take a look at some popular types of company stories to get a clearer idea:

* A beta release: users had a problem, we built a solution, we will continue to refine it based on your feedback.
* A fundraising round: we’ve been working really hard, an investment is being made, we will grow in all ways imaginable.
* An event recap: we wanted to engage with a community, we organized an event, we will organize more in the future.

## The Journey: Lessons Learned, Insights Uncovered

Now is the time to figure out what kind of story you’re going to tell. In order to so, you’ll want to ask questions that focus on education, mistakes, and insights. Let’s look at how to dig for each:

### Education:

* What did you learn along the way?
* What do you know now that would’ve helped you on day one?

### Mistakes:

* What was the hardest part of the process? What makes it so hard?

### Insights:

* What would you tell other people who are just about to get started on something similar?
* What’s the takeaway from all this?
