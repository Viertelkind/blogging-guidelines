# Tips & Tricks 

I'll contiously add more tips & tricks from great authors to help you write better so you don't have to think about it. The content strategy at BloomReach evolves and so do all people who contribute their ideas in form of blog posts or any other way.

Guidelines are about finding the balance between giving each writer their own identity, making it clear that they shouldn’t “try to do marketing” but just write as themselves, and at the same time create amazing content resources to help other people.

You’re busy, so I’ll keep this quick.

Following are the simplest tips to easily — and forever — improve the quality of your writing.

## 1. Avoid the use of “We” 

Unless it explicitly refers to every single person at BloomReach. “We” aren’t proud of this project, “I” am. “We” don’t build a CMS, “BloomReach” does. “We” didn’t write the guidelines, the content team did. Of course, you can occasionally break this rule, but it helps to guide your general style of writing.

## 3. Don't ask questions in headers. 

Answer the question instead.

## 4. Delete the word “that.”

At least 90% of the times you use the word “that” can be removed from your writing and it will instantly make your sentence stronger.

Example: “You believe that I’m lying, but I’m not.” becomes “You believe I’m lying, but I’m not.”

## 5. Delete the words “I think.”

It adds nothing. Remove it to strengthen your point.

Example: “I think this is a good sentence.” becomes “This is a good sentence.”

## 6. Avoid words that end in “-ing.”

In most cases, the “-ing” softens your word and adds no value. Your writing will read better if you avoid it.

Example: “The experiences we’re seeking end up being underwhelming and even disappointing.” becomes “The experiences we seek often underwhelm and disappoint.”

## 7. Short sentences. Short paragraphs.

Most sentences can be cut in half. Don’t be afraid to have a two or three word sentence.

Keep paragraphs to less than three sentences.

White space is your reader’s friend.

## 8. Shrink your opening sentence.

Make it compelling, but keep it short and conversational.

Example: “This is a post that’s going to help you become a better writer.” becomes “I can help you.”
